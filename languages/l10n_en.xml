		<text name="rt_help_policies_intro" text="Policies are essentially laws that you must comply with when farming. They govern things such as how you treat animals and appropriate use of land."/>
		<text name="rt_help_policies_intro_2" text="In the Policies tab you will see a list of policies. Select each to see the description of how to comply. Further down you will see a report on how you have performed. Some policies check every month, while others check less frequently. Most of the time, a policy will produce a report every month so you can track your progress."/>
		<text name="rt_help_policies_intro_3" text="If you comply with a policy, you will earn points which contribute to your compliance tier. Higher compliance tiers lead to benefits such as improved Scheme rewards and possibly tax breaks. If you violate a policy, you may receive warnings or fines depending on the severity of the violation. Where you have received a warning, an icon will appear next to the policy name and you will receive a notification in game. Address the problem to avoid a future fine."/>
		<text name="rt_help_schemes_intro" text="Schemes are optional and become available throughout the year. You can sign up to any that you wish to. Typically Schemes require you to do certain things to qualify and receive proportionate benefits. Like Policies, reports are generated to explain your performance. All rewards scale according to your Economic Difficulty Setting."/>
		<text name="rt_help_schemes_intro_2" text="Schemes might also be situational, such as a brand running a demo where you can use equipment for a time at no cost. In all cases, your compliance tier for Policies directly affects the Scheme rewards available to you. Tier D schemes give the lowest rewards, while Tier A schemes give the greatest rewards."/>
		<text name="rt_help_schemes_intro_3" text="Schemes typically run for a set period of time, often a year or a number of evaluations. Schemes will become available again in time, but you must sign up again if you wish to. Some Schemes have a limited window in which they are available. For example, the Crop Promotion scheme is only available in the first few months of the year."/>
		<text name="rt_help_tax_intro" text="Tax is a system that gives a portion of your profits to the government. A tax statement is finalised in April each year, and you will automatically pay the tax due in September. If you don't have enough money to pay the tax bill, your balance will go negative."/>
		<text name="rt_help_tax_intro_2" text="In the Tax tab, you can see a finalised statement in the left side of the view. On the right hand side you can see running totals for your current financial year. You can use this to plan ahead and reduce your tax bill. For example if you see your profits are high for the year, you might choose to purchase new equipment to reduce profit, and therefore your tax."/>
		<text name="rt_help_tax_intro_3" text="Sometimes you will see Tax Notes. These tell you when your tax statement is modified by some non-standard condition. For example, a Scheme might offer you a future tax break. This will be indicated in Tax Notes to help you understand your bill."/>
