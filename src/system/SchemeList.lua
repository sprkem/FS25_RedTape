-- Maybe an incentive to use a natural fertiliser. Like sea weed fert, its a real  thing. 
-- You could add a big bad that just says sea weed feet but works the same. But include it as a environmental policy.

    DELAYED_MOWING_BIRD_SEASON = 1, -- SFI, or just only cut twice for a payout
    BALES_OVER_FORAGING = 2, -- He also got paid for hay making. Basically, he chose to make hay and not silage in some fields. Reasons are less plastic use from wrapping, and the seeds from the wildflowers and grass get spread when baling and loading, and moving the bales.
    NATURAL_GRAZING = 3, -- Promotes natural grazing practices and biodiversity
    NATURAL_FERTILISER = 4, -- Encourages the use of natural fertilizers to improve soil health
    CROP_PROMOTION = 5, -- promotes growing specific crops. possibly split this by tier, and give equipment or cash bonuses
