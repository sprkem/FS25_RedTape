# FS25_RedTape

The mod brings more complexity and realism to the game through 3 systems: policies, schemes and taxes. 

Policies are requirements that reflect many real life things farmers need to do, such as not contaminating water sources, and taking good care of animals. Compliance with policies is currently measured in a points based system, but depending on feedback this may also involve financial benefits/fines.

Schemes are somewhat similar to policies, but are entirely optional. An example might be that the government want to promote a specific crop.
If you join the scheme, you could be given equipment such as a a harvester and cash bonuses for crops grown. The quality of schemes and rewards is impacted by your policy compliance rating.

Tax... is tax. I haven't started this yet but it's likely to be a simple tax on profits anually, possibly with tax breaks for high policy compliance. 

I am aiming to get the mod into a small testing group by November and release something by Christmas.

## Roadmap

Some rough plans are:

- More schemes (send me your ideas)
- More policies (as above)
- A system to apply for Grants, e.g. to help towards a new cow shed
- Long term: random events, e.g. your tractor was stolen.
